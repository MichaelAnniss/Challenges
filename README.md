# Space Cadet Challenges
This repository contains my worked solutions to "Space Cadets" challenges, a set of challenges given by the 
University of Southampton to challenge the most able programmers in the university. The challenges are assigned
in the first semester of the first year in the Computer Science degree.

## Running the code
This project uses Maven, so you can build the jar with `mvn install`. Unfortunately the only way to switch which challenge
Maven should build is by updating the `pom.xml` file. I did not fix this due to restrictions in how we were required to
submit the project.

### Releases
Releases can be found in this repository for each week and can be run using `java -jar /path/to/file.jar`.
